# CiviC Compiler

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the course project on the engineering of a fully-fledged compiler for CiviC - Civilised C.

## About CiviC
CiviC is not your typical programming language aiming to revolutionize the industry. Instead, it represents a model programming language, designed to encapsulate the characteristic features found in structured imperative programming languages. It offers a compact look into the world of programming languages without being overwhelming in complexity or feature richness.

This unique balance ensures that the entire CiviC compiler can be constructed in the 8-week timeframe of the course.
